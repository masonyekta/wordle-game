# Wordle Game

A Wordle game built with [electron-shadcn](https://github.com/LuanRoger/electron-shadcn). It uses an [API endpoint](https://github.com/masonyekta/wordle-api) to validate words and determine if the letters are correct.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository

```

Or use it as a template on GitHub

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the app

```bash
npm run start
```


## NPM script

To run any of those scripts:

```bash
npm run <script>
```

- `start`: Start the app in development mode
- `package`: Package your application into a platform-specific executable bundle and put the result in a folder.
- `make`: Generate platform-specific distributions (e.g. .exe, .dmg, etc).
- `publish`: Electron Forge's way of taking the artifacts generated by the `make` command and sending them to a service somewhere for you to distribute or use as updates.
- `lint`: Run ESLint to lint the code
- `format`: Run Prettier to check the code (it doesn't change the code)
- `format:write`: Run Prettier to format the code
- `test`: Run the default unit-test script (Vitest)
- `test:watch`: Run the default unit-test script in watch mode (Vitest)
- `test:unit`: Run the Vitest tests
- `test:e2e`: Run the Playwright tests
- `test:all`: Run all tests (Vitest and Playwright)

> The test scripts involving Playwright require the app be builded before running the tests. So, before run the tests, run the `package`, `make` or `publish` script.
